HTML-Text-Extractor

Please note that the module is in its very intial stage and can't be used as of now.

This app is based on concepts of regular expression and parsing. This module can be used to extract valuable information from html files.

The parsing.js file tries to remove all the html opening and closing tags from the html file and tries to build 
various tables related to attributes like image tables.

the structure of html tags are defined in tags.json.

I am looking for mentor and contributors.
